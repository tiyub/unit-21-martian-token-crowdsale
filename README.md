# Unit 21: Martian Token Crowdsale

![alt=""](./Instructions/Images/application-image.png)

## Background

After waiting for years and passing several tests, the Martian Aerospace Agency selected a prominent fintech professional to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. Their decision was that the new system be based on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named **KaseiCoin**. Kasei after the Japanese word for Mars.

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token thatâ€™s ERC-20 compliant. A crowdsale where people moving to Mars can convert their Earth fiat money to KaseiCoin.

## Evaluation Evidence

#### Develop KaseiCoin.sol smart contract that will mint the KAI

KaseiCoin inherits the following contracts from the OpenZeppelin library:

    * `ERC20`  
    * `ERC20Detailed`
    * `ERC20Mintable`

Test compile failed due to `uint initial_supply` being an unsed variable.

To compile with no errors unused var `uint initial_supply` was commented. Screenshot of successful compilation of the Kasei constructor definition contract below.

Test compile of `KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol` with errors. `KaseiCoin.sol` constructor contract was not in uploaded remix.ethereum.org.
