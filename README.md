After waiting for years and passing several tests, the Martian Aerospace Agency selected a prominent fintech professional to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. Their decision was that the new system be based on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named KaseiCoin. Kasei after the Japanese word for Mars.  KaseiCoin will be a fungible token thatâ€™s ERC-20 compliant. A crowdsale where people moving to Mars can convert their Earth fiat money to KaseiCoin.
